# Cyphernode

Indirection layer between client and Bitcoin-related services.

Here's the plan:

- The containers are not publicly exposing ports.
- Everything is accessible exclusively within the encrypted overlay network.
- If your system is distributed:
  - ...should be doubly encrypted by an OpenVPN tunnel
  - ...the hosts should be secured and the VPN tunnel should have limited scope by iptables rules on each host.
- We can have different Bitcoin Nodes for watching and spending, giving the flexibility to have different security models one each.
- Only the Proxy has Bitcoin Node RPC credentials.
- The Proxy is exclusively accessible by the Overlay network's containers.
- To manually manage the Proxy (and have access to it), one has to gain access to the Docker host servers as a docker user.
- **Coming soon**: added security to use the spending features of the Proxy with Trezor and Coldcard.

## Setting up

Default setup assumes your Bitcoin Node is already running somewhere.  The reason is that it takes a lot of disk space and often already exists in your infrastructure, why not reusing it.  After all, full blockchain sync takes a while.

You could also just uncomment it in the docker-compose file.  If you run it in pruned mode, say so in config.properties.  The computefees feature won't work in pruned mode.

### Set the swarm
(10.8.0.2 is the host's VPN IP address)

```shell
debian@dev:~/dev/Cyphernode$ docker swarm init --task-history-limit 1 --advertise-addr 10.8.0.2
Swarm initialized: current node (hufy324d291dyakizsuvjd0uw) is now a manager.

To add a worker to this swarm, run the following command:

    docker swarm join --token SWMTKN-1-2pxouynn9g8si42e8g9ujwy0v9po45axx367fy0fkjhzo3l1z8-75nirjfkobl7htvpfh986pyz3 10.8.0.2:2377

To add a manager to this swarm, run 'docker swarm join-token manager' and follow the instructions.
```

### Create the Overlay Network and make sure your app joins it!
(if your app is not a Docker container, you will have to expose Cyphernode's port and secure it!  In that case, use a reverse proxy with TLS)

```shell
debian@dev:~/dev/Cyphernode$ docker network create --driver=overlay --attachable --opt encrypted cyphernodenet
debian@dev:~/dev/Cyphernode$ docker network connect cyphernodenet yourappcontainer
```

### Configuration

```shell
debian@dev:~/dev/Cyphernode$ vi proxy_docker/env.properties
debian@dev:~/dev/Cyphernode$ vi proxy_docker/app/config/config.properties
debian@dev:~/dev/Cyphernode$ vi proxy_docker/app/config/watcher_btcnode_curlcfg.properties
debian@dev:~/dev/Cyphernode$ vi proxy_docker/app/config/spender_btcnode_curlcfg.properties
debian@dev:~/dev/Cyphernode$ vi cron_docker/env.properties
debian@dev:~/dev/Cyphernode$ vi pycoin_docker/env.properties
```

### Deploy

**Edit docker-compose.yml to specify special deployment constraints or if you want to run the Bitcoin node on the same machine: uncomment corresponding lines.**

```shell
debian@dev:~/dev/Cyphernode$ docker stack deploy --compose-file docker-compose.yml cyphernodestack
Creating service cyphernodestack_authapi
Creating service cyphernodestack_cyphernode
Creating service cyphernodestack_proxycronnode
Creating service cyphernodestack_pycoinnode
Creating service cyphernodestack_clightningnode
```

## Off-site Bitcoin Node

This section is useful if you already have a Bitcoin Core node running and you want to use it in Cyphernode.  In that case, please comment out the btcnode section from docker-compose.yml.

### Join swarm created on Cyphernode server

```shell
pi@SP-BTC01:~ $ docker swarm join --token SWMTKN-1-2pxouynn9g8si42e8g9ujwy0v9po45axx367fy0fkjhzo3l1z8-75nirjfkobl7htvpfh986pyz3 10.8.0.2:2377
```

### Build node container image

[See how to build Bitcoin Node image](https://github.com/SatoshiPortal/dockers/tree/master/rpi/bitcoin-core)

### Run node or connect already-running node

```shell
pi@SP-BTC01:~ $ docker run -d --rm --mount type=bind,source="$HOME/.bitcoin",target="/bitcoinuser/.bitcoin" --name btcnode --network cyphernodenet btcnode
```

```shell
pi@SP-BTC01:~ $ docker network connect cyphernodenet btcnode
```
